### Notes/concerns/risks

project, if you were unable to answer any questions above, or
otherwise have concerns about the appropriateness of the software.  If
the project requires a contributor license agreement or other
procedural steps, please explain here.  "None at this time" is
acceptable for this question.

To contribute code to the project, contributors must agree to the NumPy Contributor Agreement (NCA), which is a legal document that outlines the terms and conditions of contributing to the NumPy project. For some of the questions above, such as the typical commit size and the number of commits per week I had to estimate.
